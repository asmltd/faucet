#Flow Manager UI


## Reading Real-time Information On Switches

It is difficult to read the real-time information on flows installed on the switches managed by a controller. In addition, it is difficult to efficiently manage the Flow of a switch. 


## Solution Approach

Have developed the User Interface to represent the switchâ€™s data in a legible and readable tables. The UI interface is enhanced with several functionalities like View, Search, and Delete in the interface. 
 
  
## Key functionalities
- Manage flows ( add, edit and delete flows )
- Graphical and Tabulated view of Flows with pagination
- Manage users
- Secure API ( re-usable in other application )
 
## Deployment Details


**Pre-requisites**:  Ubuntu OS,Python2.7,Nginx, and UWSGI
