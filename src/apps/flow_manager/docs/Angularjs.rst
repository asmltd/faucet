AngularJS Extends HTML
    AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives:

    * The ``ng-app`` directive defines an AngularJS application.

    * The ``ng-model`` directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

    * The ``ng-bind`` directive binds application data to the HTML view.

    * The ``ng-controller`` directive defines the controller.
